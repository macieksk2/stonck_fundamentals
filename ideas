  1.8 What is arbitrage?

Arbitrage is making a sure profit in excess of the risk free rate of return. In the language of quantitative finance we can say an arbitrage opportunity is a portfolio of zero value today which is of positive value in the future with positive probability and of negative value in the future with zero probability. The assumption that there are no arbitrage opportunities in the market is fundamental to classical finance theory. This idea is popularly known as ‘there’s no such thing as a free lunch.’

Example
•	An at-the-money European call option with a strike of$100 and an expiration of six months is worth $8. 
•	A European put with the same strike and expiration is worth $6. 
•	There are no dividends on the stock and a six-month zero-coupon bond with a principal of $100 is worth $97.
•	Buy the call and a bond, sell the put and the stock, which will bring in $ − 8 − 97 + 6 + 100 = $1. 
•	At expiration this portfolio will be worthless regardless of the final price of the stock. 
•	You will make a profit of $1with no risk. This is arbitrage. It is an example of the violation of put-call parity.
Long Answer
The principle of no arbitrage is one of the foundations of classical finance theory. In derivatives theory it is assumed during the derivation of the binomial model option pricing algorithm and in the Black–Scholes model. In these cases it is rather more complicated than the simple example given above. In the above example  set up a portfolio that gave us an immediate profit, and that portfolio did not have to be touched until expiration. This is a case of a static arbitrage. Another special feature of the above example is that it does not rely on any assumptions about how the stock price behaves. So the example is that of model-independent arbitrage. However, when deriving the famous option pricing models we rely on a dynamic strategy, called delta hedging, in which a portfolio consisting of an option and stock is constantly adjusted by purchase or sale of stock in a very specific manner. Now we can see that there are several types of arbitrage that we can think of. Here is a list and description of the most important.
• A static arbitrage is an arbitrage that does not require rebalancing of positions
• A dynamic arbitrage is an arbitrage that requires trading instruments in the future, generally contingent on market states
• A statistical arbitrage is not an arbitrage but simply a likely profit in excess of the risk-free return (perhaps even suitably adjusted for risk taken) as predicted by past statistics
• Model-independent arbitrage is an arbitrage which does not depend on any mathematical model of financial instruments to work. For example, an  exploitable violation of put-call parity or a violation of the relationship between spot and forward prices, or between bonds and swaps
• Model-dependent arbitrage does require a model. For example, options mispriced because of incorrect volatility estimate. To profit from the arbitrage you need to delta hedge and that requires a model.
Not all apparent arbitrage opportunities can be exploited in practice. If you see such an opportunity in quoted prices on a screen in front of you then you are likely to find that when you try to take advantage of them they just evaporate. Here are several reasons for this.
• Quoted prices are wrong or not tradeable
• Option and stock prices were not quoted synchronously
• There is a bid-offer spread you have not accounted for
• Your model is wrong, or there is a risk factor you have not accounted for
	1.9 Delta hedging

Delta hedging One of the building blocks of derivatives theory is delta hedging. This is the theoretically perfect elimination of all risk by using a very clever hedge between the option and its underlying. Delta hedging exploits the perfect correlation between the changes in the option value and the changes in the stock price. This is an example of ‘dynamic’ hedging; the hedge must be continually monitored and frequently adjusted by the sale or purchase of the underlying asset. Because of the frequent rehedging, any dynamic hedging strategy is going to result in losses due to transaction costs. In some markets this can be very important. The ‘underlying’ in a delta-hedged portfolio could be a traded asset, a stock for example, or it could be another random quantity that determines a price such as a risk of default. If you have two instruments depending on the same risk of default, you can calculate the sensitivities, the deltas, of their prices to this quantity and then buy the two instruments in amounts inversely proportional to these deltas (one long, one short). This is also delta hedging. If two underlyings are very highly correlated you can use one as a proxy for the other for hedging purposes. You would then only be exposed to basis risk. Be careful with this because there may be times when the close relationship breaks down. If you have many financial instruments that are uncorrelated with each other then you can construct a portfolio with much less risk than any one of the instruments individually. With a large such portfolio you can theoretically reduce risk to negligible levels. Although this isn’t strictly hedging it achieves the same goal.
	1.10 Risk neutral measure
Risk-neutral valuation means that you can value options in terms of their expected payoffs, discounted from expiration to the present, assuming that they grow on average at the risk-free rate .
Option value = Expected present value of payoff(under a risk-neutral random walk).
Therefore the real rate at which the underlying grows on average doesn’t affect the value. Of course, the volatility, related to the standard deviation of the underlying’s return, does matter. In practice, it’s usually much, much harder to estimate this average growth than the volatility, so we are rather spoiled in derivatives, that we only need to estimate the relatively stable parameter, volatility. The reason that this is true is that by hedging an option with the underlying we remove any exposure to the direction of the stock, whether it goes up or down ceases to matter. By eliminating risk in this way we also remove any dependence on the value of risk. End result is that we may as well imagine we are in a world in which no one values risk at all, and all tradeable assets grow at the risk-free rate on average. For any derivative product, as long as we can hedge it dynamically and perfectly (supposing we can as in the case of known, deterministic volatility and no defaults) the hedged portfolio loses its randomness and behaves like a bond.
2I should emphasize the word ‘relatively.’ Volatility does varying reality, but probably not as much as the growth rate.
Example
A stock whose value is currently $44.75 is growing on average by 15% per annum. Its volatility is 22%. The interest rate is 4%. You want to value a call option with a strike of $45, expiring in two months’ time. What can you do? First of all, the 15% average growth is totally irrelevant. The stock’s growth and therefore its real direction does not affect the value of derivatives. What you can do is simulate many, many future paths of a stock with an average growth of 4% per annum, since that is the risk free interest rate, and a 22% volatility, to find out where it may be in two months’ time. Then calculate the call payoff for each of these paths. Present value each of these back to today, and calculate the average over all paths. That’s your option value.
Long Answer
Risk-neutral valuation of derivatives exploits the perfect correlation between the changes in the value of an option and its underlying asset. As long as the underlying is the only random factor then this correlation should be perfect. So if an option goes up in value with a rise in the stock then a long option and sufficiently short stock position shouldn’t have any random fluctuations, therefore the stock hedges the option. The resulting portfolio is risk free. Of course, you need to know the correct number of the stock to sell short. That’s called the ‘delta’ and usually comes from a model. Because we usually need a mathematical model to calculate the delta, and because quantitative finance models are necessarily less than perfect, the theoretical elimination of risk by delta hedging is also less than perfect in practice. There are several such imperfections with risk-neutral valuation. First, it requires continuous rebalancing of the hedge. Delta is constantly changing so you must always be buying or selling stock to maintain a risk-free position. Obviously, this is not possible in practice. Second, it hinges on the accuracy of the model. The underlying has to be consistent with certain assumptions, such as being Brownian motion without any jumps, and with known volatility. One of the most important side effects of risk-neutral pricing is that we can value derivatives by doing simulations of the risk-neutral path of underlyings, to calculate payoffs for the derivatives. These payoffs are then discounted to the present, and finally averaged. This average that we find is the contract’s fair value. Here are some further explanations of risk-neutral pricing.
Explanation 1: If you hedge correctly in a Black–Scholes world then all risk is eliminated. If there is no risk then we should not expect any compensation for risk. We can therefore work under a measure in which everything grows at the risk-free interest rate.
Explanation 2: If the model for the asset is dS = μS dt +σS dX then the μs cancel in the derivation of the Black–Scholes equation.
Explanation 3: Two measures are equivalent if they have the same sets of zero probability. Because zero 
Probability sets don’t change, a portfolio is an arbitrage under one measure if and only if it is one under all equivalent measures. Therefore a price is non-arbitrageable in the real world if and only if it is non-arbitrageable in the risk-neutral world. The risk-neutral price is always nonarbitrageable. If everything has a discounted asset price process which is a martingale then there can be no arbitrage. So if we change to a measure in which all the fundamental assets, for example the stock and bond, are martingales after discounting, and then define the option price to be the discounted expectation making it into a martingale too, we have that everything is a martingale in the risk-neutral world. Therefore there is no arbitrage in the real world. 
Explanation 4: If we have calls with a continuous distribution of strikes from zero to infinity then we can synthesize arbitrarily well any payoff with the same expiration. But these calls define the risk-neutral probability density function for that expiration, and so we can interpret the synthesized option in terms of risk-neutral random walks. When such a static replication is possible then it is model independent, we can price complex derivatives in terms of vanillas. (Of course, the continuous distribution requirement does spoil this argument to some extent.) It should be noted that risk-neutral pricing only works under assumptions of continuous hedging, zero transaction costs, continuous asset paths, etc. Once we move away from this simplifying world we may find that it doesn’t work.

	1.11 Girsanov theorem
Short Answer
Girsanov’s theorem is the formal concept underlying the change of measure from the real world to the risk neutral world. We can change from a Brownian motion with one drift to a Brownian motion with another.
Example
The classical example is to start with dS = μS dt + σS dWt  with W being Brownian motion under one measure (the real-world measure) and converting it to dS = rS dt + σS d ˜Wt under a different, the risk-neutral, measure.
Long Answer
First a statement of the theorem. Let Wt be a Brownian motion with measure P and sample space _. Ifγt is a previsible process satisfying the constrain tEP_exp_12_ T0 γ 2t__< ∞ then there exists an equivalent measure Q on _ such that˜Wt = Wt +_ t0γsds is a Brownian motion. It will be helpful if we explain some of the more technical terms in this theorem. 
Sample space: All possible future states or outcomes.
(Probability) Measure: In layman’s terms, the measure gives the probabilities of each of the outcomes in the sample space.
Previsible: A previsible process is one that only depends on the previous history. 
Equivalent: Two measures are equivalent if they have the same sample space and the same set of ‘possibilities.’ Note the use of the word possibilities instead of probabilities. The two measures can have different probabilities for each outcome but must agree on what is possible. Another way of writing the above is in differential form d ˜Wt = dWt + γt dt. One important point about Girsanov’s theorem is its converse, that every equivalent measure is given by a drift change. This implies that in the Black–Scholes world there is only the one equivalent risk-neutral measure. If this were not the case then there would be multiple arbitrage-free prices. For many problems in finance Girsanov theorem is not necessarily useful. This is often the case in the world of equity derivatives. Straightforward Black–Scholes does not require any understanding of Girsanov. Once you go beyond basic Black–Scholes it becomes more useful. For example, suppose you want to derive the valuation partial differential equations for options under stochastic volatility. The stock price follows the real world processes, P,
 dS = μS dt + σS dX1 
and 
dσ = a(S, σ, t)dt + b(S, σ, t)dWX2, 
where dX1 and dX2 are correlated Brownian motions with correlation ρ(S, σ, t).
Using Girsanov you can get the governing equation in three steps:
1. Under a pricing measure Q, Girsanov plus the fact that S is traded implies that dX1 = d˜X1 − μ – rσdt and dX2 = d˜X2 − λ(S, σ, t) dt, where λ is the market price of volatility risk
2. Apply Itˆo’s formula to the discounted option price V(S, σ, t) = e−r(T−t)F(S, σ, t), expanding under Q, using the formulæ for dS and dV obtained from the Girsanov transformation
3. Since the option is traded, the coefficient of the dt term in its Itˆo expansion must also be zero; this yields the relevant equation Girsanov and the idea of change of measure are particularly important in the fixed-income world where practitioners often have to deal with many different measures at the same time, corresponding to different maturities. This is the reason for the popularity of the BGM model and its ilk.

	1.14 Greeks
	1.15 Volatility smile
	1.16 Monte Carlo simulation
	1.17 Why do quants like closed-form solutions? 

Short Answer
Because they are fast to compute and easy to understand.
Example
The Black–Scholes formulæ are simple and closed-form and often used despite people knowing that they have limitations, and despite being used for products for which they were not originally intended.
Long Answer
There are various pressures on a quant when it comes to choosing a model. What he’d really like is a model that is
• robust: small changes in the random process for the underlying don’t matter too much
• fast: prices and the greeks have to be quick to compute for several reasons, so that the trade gets done and you don’t lose out to a competitor, and so that positions can be managed in real time as just one small part of a large portfolio
• accurate: in a scientific sense the prices ought to be good, perhaps matching historical data. This is different from robust, of course
• easy to calibrate: banks like to have models that match traded prices of simple contracts
There is some overlap in these. Fast may also mean easy to calibrate, but not necessarily. Accurate and robust might be similar, but again, not always. From the scientific point of view the most important of these is accuracy. The least important is speed. To the scientist the question of calibration becomes one concerning the existence of arbitrage. If you are a hedge fund looking for prop trading opportunities with vanillas then calibration is precisely what you don’t want to do. And robustness would be nice, but maybe the financial world is so unstable that models can never be robust. To the practitioner he needs to be able to price quickly to get the deal done and to manage the risk. If he is in the business of selling exotic contracts then he will invariably be calibrating, so that he can say that his prices are consistent with vanillas. As long as the model isn’t too inaccurate or sensitive, and he can add a sufficient profit margin, then he will be content. So to the practitioner speed and ability to calibrate to the market are the most important. The scientist and the practitioner have conflicting interests. And the practitioner usually wins. And what could be faster than a closed-form solution? This is why practitioners tend to favour closed forms. They also tend to be easier to understand intuitively than a numerical solution. The Black–Scholes formulæ are perfect for this, having a simple interpretation in terms of expectations, and using the cumulative distribution function for the Gaussian distribution. Such is the desire for simple formulæ that people often use the formulæ for the wrong product. Suppose you want to price certain Asian options based on an arithmetic average. To do this properly in the Black–Scholes world you would do this by solving a three-dimensional partial differential equation or by Monte Carlo simulation. But if you pretend that the averaging is geometric and not arithmetic then often there are simple closed form solutions. So use those, even though they must be wrong. The point is that they will probably be less wrong than other assumptions you are making, such as what future volatility will be. Of course, the definition of closed form is to some extent in the eye of the beholder. If an option can be priced in terms of an infinite sum of hypergeometric functions does that count? Some Asian options can be priced that way. Or what about a closed form involving a subtle integration in the complex plane that must ultimately be done numerically? That is the Heston stochastic volatility model. If closed form is so appreciated, is it worth spending much time seeking them out? Probably not. There are always new products being invented and new pricing models being devised, but they are unlikely to be of the simple type that can be solved explicitly. Chances are that either you will have to solve these numerically, or approximate them by something not too dissimilar. Approximations such as Black ’76 are probably your best chance of finding closed-form solutions for new products these days.

	1.18 What are the forward and backward equations?
Short Answer
Forward and backward equations usually refer to the differential equations governing the transition probability density function for a stochastic process. They are diffusion equations and must therefore be solved in the appropriate direction in time, hence the names.
Example
An exchange rate is currently 1.88. What is the probability that it will be over 2 by this time next year? If you have a stochastic differential equation model for this exchange rate then this question can be answered using the equations for the transition probability density function.
Long Answer
Let us suppose that we have a random variable y evolving according to a quite general, one-factor stochastic differential equation dy = A(y, t) dt + B(y, t) dX. Here A and B are both arbitrary functions of y and t. Many common models can be written in this form, including the lognormal asset random walk, and common spot interest rate models. The transition probability density function p(y, t; y	, t	)is the function of four variables defined by Prob(a < y < b at time t	|y at time t)=_ bap(y, t; y	, t	) dy. This simply means the probability that the random variable y lies between a and b at time t	 in the future, given that it started out with value y at time t. You can think of y and t as being current or starting values withy	 and t	 being future values. The transition probability density function p(y, t; y	, t	)satisfies two equations, one involving derivatives with respect to the future state and time (y	 and t	) and called the forward equation, and the other involving derivatives with respect to the current state and time(y and t) and called the backward equation. These two equations are parabolic partial differential equations not dissimilar to the Black–Scholes equation. 
The forward equation Also known as the Fokker–Planck or forward Kolmogorov equation 
This forward parabolic partial differential equation requires initial conditions at time t and to be solved for t> t.
Example: An important example is that of the distribution of equity prices in the future
The backward equation Also known as the backward Kolmogorov equation this is∂p∂t+ 12B(y, t)2 ∂2p∂y2+ A(y, t)∂p∂y= 0.This must be solved backwards in t with specified final data. For example, if we wish to calculate the expected value of some function F(S) at time T we must solve this equation for the function p(S, t) with p(S, T) = F(S).Option prices If we have the lognormal random walk for S, as above, and we transform the dependent variable using a discount factor according to p(S, t) = er(T−t)V(S, t),then the backward equation for p becomes an equation for V which is identical to the Black–Scholes partial differential equation. Identical but for one subtlety, the equation contains a μ where Black–Scholes contains r. We can conclude that the fair value of an option is the present value of the expected payoff at expiration under a risk-neutral random walk for the underlying. Risk neutral here means replace μ with r.
	1.19 What is meant by ‘complete’ and ‘incomplete’ markets?
Short Answer
A complete market is one in which a derivative product can be artificially made from more basic instruments, such as cash and the underlying asset. This usually involves dynamically rebalancing a portfolio of the simpler instruments, according to some formula or algorithm, to replicate the more complicated product, the derivative. Obviously, an incomplete market is one in which you can’t replicate the option with simpler instruments.
Example
The classic example is replicating an equity option, a call, say, by continuously buying or selling the equity so that you always hold the amount_ = e−D(T−t)N(d1),in the stock, where N(x) = 1 √2π_ x−∞e−12 φ2dφandd1 =ln(S/E) + (r − D + 12σ2)(T − t)σ√T – t.
Long Answer
A slightly more mathematical, yet still quite easily understood, description is to say that a complete market is one for which there exist the same number of linearly independent securities as there are states of the world in the future. Consider, for example, the binomial model in which there are two states of the world at the next time step, and there are also two securities, cash and the stock. That is a complete market. Now, after two time steps there will be three possible states of the world, assuming the binomial model recombines so that an up-down move gets you to the same place as down-up. You might think that you therefore need three securities for a complete market. This is not the case because after the first time step you get to change the quantity of stock you are holding, this is where the dynamic part of the replication comes in. In the equity world the two most popular models for equity prices are the lognormal, with a constant volatility, and the binomial. Both of these result in complete markets, you can replicate other contracts in these worlds. In a complete market you can replicate derivatives with the simpler instruments. But you can also turn this on its head so that you can hedge the derivative with the underlying instruments to make a risk-free instrument. In the binomial model you can replicate an option from stock and cash, or you can hedge the option with the stock to make cash. Same idea, same equations, just move terms to be on different sides of the ‘equals’ sign. As well as resulting in replication of derivatives, or the ability to hedge them, complete markets also have a nice mathematical property. Think of the binomial model. In this model you specify the probability of the stock rising (and hence falling because the probabilities must add to one). It turns out that this probability does not affect the price of the option. This is a simple consequence of complete markets, since you can hedge the option with the stock you don’t care whether the stock rises or falls, and so you don’t care what the probabilities are. People can therefore disagree on the probability of a stock rising or falling but still agree on the value of an option, as long as they share the same view on the stock’s volatility. In probabilistic terms we say that in a complete market there exists a unique martingale measure, but for an incomplete market there is no unique martingale measure. The interpretation of this is that even though options are risky instruments we don’t have to specify our own degree of risk aversion in order to price them. Enough of complete markets, where can we find incomplete markets? The answer is ‘everywhere.’ In practice, all markets are incomplete because of real-world effects that violate the assumptions of the simple models. Take volatility as an example. As long as we have a lognormal equity random walk, no transaction costs, continuous hedging, perfectly divisible assets,. . ., and constant volatility then we have a complete market. If that volatility is a known time-dependent function then the market is still complete. It is even still complete if the volatility is a known function of stock price and time. But as soon as that volatility becomes random then the market is no longer complete. This is because there are now more states of the world than there are linearly independent securities. In reality, we don’t know what volatility will be in the future so markets are incomplete. We also get incomplete markets if the underlying follows a jump-diffusion process. Again more possible states than there are underlying securities. Another common reason for getting incompleteness is if the underlying or one of the variables governing the behaviour of the underlying is random. Options on terrorist acts cannot be hedged since terrorist acts aren’t traded (to my knowledge at least).We still have to price contracts even in incomplete markets, so what can we do? There are two main ideas here. One is to price the actuarial way, the other is to try to make all option prices consistent with each other. The actuarial way is to look at pricing in some average sense. Even if you can’t hedge the risk from each option it doesn’t necessarily matter in the long run. Because in that long run you will have made many hundreds or thousands of option trades, so all that really matters is what the average price of each contract should be, even if it is risky. To some extent this relies on results from the Central Limit Theorem. This is called the actuarial approach because it is how the insurance business works. You can’t hedge the lifespan of individual policyholders but you can figure out what will happen to hundreds of thousands of them on average using actuarial tables. The other way of pricing is to make options consistent with each other. This is commonly used when we have stochastic volatility models, for example, and is also often seen in fixed-income derivatives pricing. Let’s work with the stochastic volatility model to get inspiration. Suppose we have a lognormal random walk with stochastic volatility. This means we have two sources of randomness (stock and volatility) but only one quantity with which to hedge (stock). That’s like saying that there are more states of the world than underlying securities, hence incompleteness. Well, we know we can hedge the stock price risk with the stock, leaving us with only one source of risk that we can’t get rid of. That’s like saying there is one extra degree of freedom in states of the world than there are securities .Whenever you have risk that you can’t get rid of you have to ask how that risk should be valued. The more risk the more return you expect to make in excess of the risk-free rate. This introduces the idea of the market price of risk. Technically in this case it introduces the market price of volatility risk. This measures the excess expected return in relation to unhedgeable risk. Now all options on this stock with the random volatility have the same sort of unhedgeable risk, some may have more or less risk than others but they are all exposed to volatility risk. The end result is a pricing model which explicitly contains this market price of risk parameter. This ensures that the prices of all options are consistent with each other via this ‘universal’ parameter. Another interpretation is that you price options in terms of the prices of other options.
	1.20 Interest rate modelling (Hull White, Vasicek, Ho Lee, …)
1977 Vasicek So far quantitative finance hadn’t had much to say about pricing interest rate products. Some people were using equity option formulæ for pricing interest rate options, but a consistent framework for interest rates had not been developed. This was addressed by Vasicek. He started by modelling a short-term interest rate as a random walk and concluded that interest rate derivatives could be valued using equations similar to the Black–Scholes partial differential equation. Oldrich Vasicek represented the short-term interest rate by a stochastic differential equation of the form dr = μ(r, t) dt + σ(r, t) dX. The bond pricing equation is a parabolic partial differential equation, similar to the Black–Scholes equation. See Vasicek (1977).
1986 Ho and Lee One of the problems with the Vasicek framework for interest rate derivative products was tha tit didn’t give very good prices for bonds, the simplest of fixed income products. If the model couldn’t even get bond prices right, how could it hope to correctly value bond options? Thomas Ho and Sang-Bin Lee found a way around this, introducing the idea of yield curve fitting or calibration. See Ho and Lee (1986).
1992 Heath, Jarrow and Morton Although Ho and Lee showed how to match theoretical and market prices for simple bonds, the methodology was rather cumbersome and not easily generalized. David Heath, Robert Jarrow and Andrew Morton took a different approach. Instead of modelling just a short rate and deducing the whole yield curve, they modelled the random evolution of the whole yield curve. The initial yield curve, and hence the value of simple interest rate instruments, was an input to the model. The model cannot easily be expressed in differential equation terms and so relies on either Monte Carlo simulation or tree building. The work was well known via a working paper, but was finally published, and therefore made respectable in Heath, Jarrow and Morton (1992).
2002 Hagan, Kumar, Lesniewski, Woodward There has always been a need for models that are both fast and match traded prices well. The interest-rate model of Pat Hagan, Deep Kumar, Andrew Lesniewski & Diana Woodward(2002) which has come to be called the SABR (stochastic,α, β, ρ) model is a model for a forward rate and its volatility, both of which are stochastic. This model is made tractable by exploiting an asymptotic approximation to the governing equation that is highly accurate in practice. The asymptotic analysis simplifies a problem that would otherwise have to be solved numerically. Although asymptotic analysis has been used in financial problems before, for example in modelling transaction costs, this was the first time it really entered mainstream quantitative finance.
