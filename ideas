 1.8 What is arbitrage?

Arbitrage is making a sure profit in excess of the risk free rate of return. In the language of quantitative finance we can say an arbitrage opportunity is a portfolio of zero value today which is of positive value in the future with positive probability and of negative value in the future with zero probability. The assumption that there are no arbitrage opportunities in the market is fundamental to classical finance theory. This idea is popularly known as ‘there’s no such thing as a free lunch.’

Example
•	An at-the-money European call option with a strike of$100 and an expiration of six months is worth $8. 
•	A European put with the same strike and expiration is worth $6. 
•	There are no dividends on the stock and a six-month zero-coupon bond with a principal of $100 is worth $97.
•	Buy the call and a bond, sell the put and the stock, which will bring in $ − 8 − 97 + 6 + 100 = $1. 
•	At expiration this portfolio will be worthless regardless of the final price of the stock. 
•	You will make a profit of $1with no risk. This is arbitrage. It is an example of the violation of put-call parity.
Long Answer
The principle of no arbitrage is one of the foundations of classical finance theory. In derivatives theory it is assumed during the derivation of the binomial model option pricing algorithm and in the Black–Scholes model. In these cases it is rather more complicated than the simple example given above. In the above example  set up a portfolio that gave us an immediate profit, and that portfolio did not have to be touched until expiration. This is a case of a static arbitrage. Another special feature of the above example is that it does not rely on any assumptions about how the stock price behaves. So the example is that of model-independent arbitrage. However, when deriving the famous option pricing models we rely on a dynamic strategy, called delta hedging, in which a portfolio consisting of an option and stock is constantly adjusted by purchase or sale of stock in a very specific manner. Now we can see that there are several types of arbitrage that we can think of. Here is a list and description of the most important.
• A static arbitrage is an arbitrage that does not require rebalancing of positions
• A dynamic arbitrage is an arbitrage that requires trading instruments in the future, generally contingent on market states
• A statistical arbitrage is not an arbitrage but simply a likely profit in excess of the risk-free return (perhaps even suitably adjusted for risk taken) as predicted by past statistics
• Model-independent arbitrage is an arbitrage which does not depend on any mathematical model of financial instruments to work. For example, an  exploitable violation of put-call parity or a violation of the relationship between spot and forward prices, or between bonds and swaps
• Model-dependent arbitrage does require a model. For example, options mispriced because of incorrect volatility estimate. To profit from the arbitrage you need to delta hedge and that requires a model.
Not all apparent arbitrage opportunities can be exploited in practice. If you see such an opportunity in quoted prices on a screen in front of you then you are likely to find that when you try to take advantage of them they just evaporate. Here are several reasons for this.
• Quoted prices are wrong or not tradeable
• Option and stock prices were not quoted synchronously
• There is a bid-offer spread you have not accounted for
• Your model is wrong, or there is a risk factor you have not accounted for
	1.9 Delta hedging

Delta hedging One of the building blocks of derivatives theory is delta hedging. This is the theoretically perfect elimination of all risk by using a very clever hedge between the option and its underlying. Delta hedging exploits the perfect correlation between the changes in the option value and the changes in the stock price. This is an example of ‘dynamic’ hedging; the hedge must be continually monitored and frequently adjusted by the sale or purchase of the underlying asset. Because of the frequent rehedging, any dynamic hedging strategy is going to result in losses due to transaction costs. In some markets this can be very important. The ‘underlying’ in a delta-hedged portfolio could be a traded asset, a stock for example, or it could be another random quantity that determines a price such as a risk of default. If you have two instruments depending on the same risk of default, you can calculate the sensitivities, the deltas, of their prices to this quantity and then buy the two instruments in amounts inversely proportional to these deltas (one long, one short). This is also delta hedging. If two underlyings are very highly correlated you can use one as a proxy for the other for hedging purposes. You would then only be exposed to basis risk. Be careful with this because there may be times when the close relationship breaks down. If you have many financial instruments that are uncorrelated with each other then you can construct a portfolio with much less risk than any one of the instruments individually. With a large such portfolio you can theoretically reduce risk to negligible levels. Although this isn’t strictly hedging it achieves the same goal.
	1.10 Risk neutral measure
Risk-neutral valuation means that you can value options in terms of their expected payoffs, discounted from expiration to the present, assuming that they grow on average at the risk-free rate .
Option value = Expected present value of payoff(under a risk-neutral random walk).
Therefore the real rate at which the underlying grows on average doesn’t affect the value. Of course, the volatility, related to the standard deviation of the underlying’s return, does matter. In practice, it’s usually much, much harder to estimate this average growth than the volatility, so we are rather spoiled in derivatives, that we only need to estimate the relatively stable parameter, volatility. The reason that this is true is that by hedging an option with the underlying we remove any exposure to the direction of the stock, whether it goes up or down ceases to matter. By eliminating risk in this way we also remove any dependence on the value of risk. End result is that we may as well imagine we are in a world in which no one values risk at all, and all tradeable assets grow at the risk-free rate on average. For any derivative product, as long as we can hedge it dynamically and perfectly (supposing we can as in the case of known, deterministic volatility and no defaults) the hedged portfolio loses its randomness and behaves like a bond.
2I should emphasize the word ‘relatively.’ Volatility does varying reality, but probably not as much as the growth rate.
Example
A stock whose value is currently $44.75 is growing on average by 15% per annum. Its volatility is 22%. The interest rate is 4%. You want to value a call option with a strike of $45, expiring in two months’ time. What can you do? First of all, the 15% average growth is totally irrelevant. The stock’s growth and therefore its real direction does not affect the value of derivatives. What you can do is simulate many, many future paths of a stock with an average growth of 4% per annum, since that is the risk free interest rate, and a 22% volatility, to find out where it may be in two months’ time. Then calculate the call payoff for each of these paths. Present value each of these back to today, and calculate the average over all paths. That’s your option value.
Long Answer
Risk-neutral valuation of derivatives exploits the perfect correlation between the changes in the value of an option and its underlying asset. As long as the underlying is the only random factor then this correlation should be perfect. So if an option goes up in value with a rise in the stock then a long option and sufficiently short stock position shouldn’t have any random fluctuations, therefore the stock hedges the option. The resulting portfolio is risk free. Of course, you need to know the correct number of the stock to sell short. That’s called the ‘delta’ and usually comes from a model. Because we usually need a mathematical model to calculate the delta, and because quantitative finance models are necessarily less than perfect, the theoretical elimination of risk by delta hedging is also less than perfect in practice. There are several such imperfections with risk-neutral valuation. First, it requires continuous rebalancing of the hedge. Delta is constantly changing so you must always be buying or selling stock to maintain a risk-free position. Obviously, this is not possible in practice. Second, it hinges on the accuracy of the model. The underlying has to be consistent with certain assumptions, such as being Brownian motion without any jumps, and with known volatility. One of the most important side effects of risk-neutral pricing is that we can value derivatives by doing simulations of the risk-neutral path of underlyings, to calculate payoffs for the derivatives. These payoffs are then discounted to the present, and finally averaged. This average that we find is the contract’s fair value. Here are some further explanations of risk-neutral pricing.
Explanation 1: If you hedge correctly in a Black–Scholes world then all risk is eliminated. If there is no risk then we should not expect any compensation for risk. We can therefore work under a measure in which everything grows at the risk-free interest rate.
Explanation 2: If the model for the asset is dS = μS dt +σS dX then the μs cancel in the derivation of the Black–Scholes equation.
Explanation 3: Two measures are equivalent if they have the same sets of zero probability. Because zero 
Probability sets don’t change, a portfolio is an arbitrage under one measure if and only if it is one under all equivalent measures. Therefore a price is non-arbitrageable in the real world if and only if it is non-arbitrageable in the risk-neutral world. The risk-neutral price is always nonarbitrageable. If everything has a discounted asset price process which is a martingale then there can be no arbitrage. So if we change to a measure in which all the fundamental assets, for example the stock and bond, are martingales after discounting, and then define the option price to be the discounted expectation making it into a martingale too, we have that everything is a martingale in the risk-neutral world. Therefore there is no arbitrage in the real world. 
Explanation 4: If we have calls with a continuous distribution of strikes from zero to infinity then we can synthesize arbitrarily well any payoff with the same expiration. But these calls define the risk-neutral probability density function for that expiration, and so we can interpret the synthesized option in terms of risk-neutral random walks. When such a static replication is possible then it is model independent, we can price complex derivatives in terms of vanillas. (Of course, the continuous distribution requirement does spoil this argument to some extent.) It should be noted that risk-neutral pricing only works under assumptions of continuous hedging, zero transaction costs, continuous asset paths, etc. Once we move away from this simplifying world we may find that it doesn’t work.

	1.11 Girsanov theorem
Short Answer
Girsanov’s theorem is the formal concept underlying the change of measure from the real world to the risk neutral world. We can change from a Brownian motion with one drift to a Brownian motion with another.
Example
The classical example is to start with dS = μS dt + σS dWt  with W being Brownian motion under one measure (the real-world measure) and converting it to dS = rS dt + σS d ˜Wt under a different, the risk-neutral, measure.
Long Answer
First a statement of the theorem. Let Wt be a Brownian motion with measure P and sample space _. Ifγt is a previsible process satisfying the constrain tEP_exp_12_ T0 γ 2t__< ∞ then there exists an equivalent measure Q on _ such that˜Wt = Wt +_ t0γsds is a Brownian motion. It will be helpful if we explain some of the more technical terms in this theorem. 
Sample space: All possible future states or outcomes.
(Probability) Measure: In layman’s terms, the measure gives the probabilities of each of the outcomes in the sample space.
Previsible: A previsible process is one that only depends on the previous history. 
Equivalent: Two measures are equivalent if they have the same sample space and the same set of ‘possibilities.’ Note the use of the word possibilities instead of probabilities. The two measures can have different probabilities for each outcome but must agree on what is possible. Another way of writing the above is in differential form d ˜Wt = dWt + γt dt. One important point about Girsanov’s theorem is its converse, that every equivalent measure is given by a drift change. This implies that in the Black–Scholes world there is only the one equivalent risk-neutral measure. If this were not the case then there would be multiple arbitrage-free prices. For many problems in finance Girsanov theorem is not necessarily useful. This is often the case in the world of equity derivatives. Straightforward Black–Scholes does not require any understanding of Girsanov. Once you go beyond basic Black–Scholes it becomes more useful. For example, suppose you want to derive the valuation partial differential equations for options under stochastic volatility. The stock price follows the real world processes, P,
 dS = μS dt + σS dX1 
and 
dσ = a(S, σ, t)dt + b(S, σ, t)dWX2, 
where dX1 and dX2 are correlated Brownian motions with correlation ρ(S, σ, t).
Using Girsanov you can get the governing equation in three steps:
1. Under a pricing measure Q, Girsanov plus the fact that S is traded implies that dX1 = d˜X1 − μ – rσdt and dX2 = d˜X2 − λ(S, σ, t) dt, where λ is the market price of volatility risk
2. Apply Itˆo’s formula to the discounted option price V(S, σ, t) = e−r(T−t)F(S, σ, t), expanding under Q, using the formulæ for dS and dV obtained from the Girsanov transformation
3. Since the option is traded, the coefficient of the dt term in its Itˆo expansion must also be zero; this yields the relevant equation Girsanov and the idea of change of measure are particularly important in the fixed-income world where practitioners often have to deal with many different measures at the same time, corresponding to different maturities. This is the reason for the popularity of the BGM model and its ilk.
